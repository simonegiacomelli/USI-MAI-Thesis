\section{Summing Up}

There exist many approaches to detect self-admitted technical debt and technical debt in general. However, to the best of our knowledge, there is no study that leverages the SATD annotations to learn a model that automatically detects technical debt using no meta-information except the bare source code.
In this work we create a dataset of method body pairs (affected with SATD and the fixed counterpart) and train a deep learning model that detects the presence or absence of technical debt in an unseen source code snippet. The study aims to investigate how much the model is able to learn and the correlation of the confidence level on the prediction outcome. Then we analyze where and why it succeeds or fail the prediction, in the context of a high level confidence.
