The Technical Debt metaphor describes a misalignment between the implemented solution and the appropriate one. Software developers accumulate technical debt when they choose speed at the expense of quality and correctness. As the debt metaphor suggests, there are multiple elements involved; two are: gain and interest. The gain is a shorter time to market and lower initial costs. The interest is all the additional effort caused by choosing the easy but limited solution, i.e. it's harder to implement changes. When the debt is not paid in a timely manner the interest can crush the evolution capabilities of the project itself. Researcher agrees that it's important to track, manage and repay technical debt to avoid dire consequences.

Developers, while introducing technical debt, can decide to leave a source code comment to document what they are doing; this is called self-admitted technical debt (SATD). A SATD is an acknowledgement that something needs to be fixed.


% There is an extensive literature on techniques to detect technical debt automatically. However, to the best of our knowledge, no study leverages SATD annotations to create a technical debt detector.
% We propose a method to use SATD comments to detect technical debt in source code using a deep learning model. 
% This thesis describes how to learn a model that classifies code snippets into two categories: TD-free or TD-affected.
% To create the dataset needed to learn the model, we processed 245,243 projects commit histories cloned from public GitHub repositories. 
% The model internally represents the code snippet as a fixed-length vector. The pre-processing pipeline extracts features from the source code (AST-paths) and they are embedded as code-vectors. Conceptually, this is similar to how word2vec works. The distance between two vectors gives a measure of how similar or dissimilar two snippets are. The last part of the model is a fully connected layer; its purpose is to perform the final binary classification of the code-vector. 

% We present a large-scale empirical study to (i) assess the accuracy of our classifier and (ii) research the correlation between the model prediction confidence and the accuracy of the prediction itself. Besides quantitatively evaluating the results, we present a qualitative analysis of concrete high confidence predictions.


% We tested the accuracy of the model on two two different datasets with unequal sizes. The results using the smaller dataset, shows 71\% for precision, 62\% recall and 66\% for F1-score. The second best precision (67\%) and the second highest F1-score (61\%) comes with the largest dataset.


% The results on the confidence level analysis show interesting results: when filtering for a confidence level greater than 0.9 we measured a gain on precision, from 71\% to 78\%; the excluded samples shows their effect also on the recall that goes from 62\% down to 52\%. When using a dataset with bigger code snippets and confidence greater than 0.9 we discard 98\% of the test predictions; however the precision is high as 99\% and the recall drops to 10\%, both due to the (correct and incorrect) discarded predictions.

A huge thanks to all the people that make my university tick. I'm grateful to all the staff of Universit\`a della Svizzera Italiana, you inspired me on the journey that led me to join the Academic Senate and the Council of the Faculty of Informatics as student representative. I met wonderful people and you all made it an invaluable learning experience. You will always have a special place in my heart. USI is a young and beautiful university, I hope you are enjoying it like I did.
